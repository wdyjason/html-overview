# Notes

to complete this lesson of HTML Form, You need to know the key points: 

- The purpose of a `<form>`  is to allow users to input information and send it.
- The `<form>` 's `action` attribute determines where the form’s information goes.
- The `<form>` 's `method` attribute determines how the information is sent and processed.
- To add fields for users to input information we use the`<input>`element and set the `type` attribute to a field of our choosing:
  - Setting `type` to `"text"` creates a single row field for text input.
  - Setting `type` to `"password"` creates a single row field that censors text input.
  - Setting `type` to `"number"` creates a single row field for number input.
  - Setting `type` to `"range"` creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
  - Setting `type` to `"checkbox"` creates a single checkbox which can be paired with other checkboxes.
  - Setting `type` to `"radio"` creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
  - Setting `type` to `"list"` will pair the `` with a `` element if the `id` of both are the same.
  - Setting `type` to `"submit"` creates a submit button.
- A `<select>` element is populated with `<option>` elements and renders a dropdown list selection.
- A `<datalist>` element is populated with `<option>` elements and works with an `<input>` to search through choices.
- A `<textarea>` element is a text input field that has a customizable area.
- When a `<form>` is submitted, the `name` of the fields that accept input and the `value` of those fields are sent as `name=value` pairs.

Using the `<form>` element in conjunction with the other elements listed above allows us to create sites that take into consideration the wants and needs of our users. Take the opportunity to take what you’ve learned, and apply it!
